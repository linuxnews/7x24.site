# Debian10配置NFS服务

## 1.服务器端安装NFS server(ip: 192.168.1.1)
```
$ apt install nfs-kernel-server portmap
```
NOTE: The portmap package is only required if you want to run an NFSv2 or NFSv3 server. If all your clients support NFSv4, you can disable NFSv2 and NFSv3 (as described in the "NFSv4 only" section below) and skip the "Portmap" section below.
## 2.服务器端建立共享目录，然后修改/etc/exports文件
```
$ mkdir /home/share
$ vim /etc/exports

#单台例子
/home/share 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0(rw,no_root_squash,subtree_check) 
#多台例子
/home/share   192.168.1.0/24(rw) 172.16.1.0/24(ro)  10.11.12.0/24(rw)

$ /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server reload
```
NOTE:This tells the server to serve up that path, readable/writable, with root-user-id connecting clients to use root access instead of being mapped to 'nobody', and to use the 'subtree_check' to silence a warning message. Then, reloads the server.

```
$ cat /proc/fs/nfsd/versions
  -2 -3 +4 +4.1 +4.2
```
NOTE:In this case, nfs2, nfs3 are disabled. NFS 4, 4.1, and 4.2 are enabled.  Any client trying to connect with NFSv2 or NFSv3 should get an error.
## 3.服务器端exports文件参数设置
```
ro: specifies that the directory may only be mounted as read only.
rw: grants both read and write permissions on the directory.
no_root_squash: is an extremely dangerous option that allows remote “root” users the same privilege as the “root” user of the host machine.
subtree_check: specifies that, in the case of a directory is exported instead of an entire filesystem, the host should verify the location of files and directories on the host filesystem.
no_subtree_check: specifies that the host should not check the location of the files being accessed withing the host filesystem.
sync: this just ensures that the host keeps any changes uploaded to the shared directory in sync.
async:ignores synchronization checks in favor of increased speed.
```
## 4.重启NFS服务器
```
$ systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```
## 5.配置nfs client
```
$ apt install nfs-common
$ mount -t nfs4 192.168.1.1:/home/share /local/file
```
## 6.如果希望系统每次启动自动加载nfs共享，修改/etc/fstab 
```
$ vim /etc/fstab
192.168.1.1:/home/share	/local/file	nfs4	defaults,user,exec	0 0
```
If you aren't certain if the share will always be available on the client, add noauto to the list of options to prevent your system from trying to mount it automatically.
```
192.168.1.1:/home/share	/local/file	nfs4	defaults,user,exec,noauto	0 0
```
